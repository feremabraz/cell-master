## 2. World & Character Creation

### 2.1 World Generation

- **Setting Seed**: The AI prompts the player for a single-word theme (e.g., "Ashenvale") to inspire the world’s creation. Based on this seed, the AI dynamically generates the world’s regions, terrain, and characteristics.
- **Region Breakdown**: The AI generates a variable number of regions (e.g., four), each with unique terrain types (e.g., forests, deserts, mountains, swamps, ruins, etc.) and thematic elements tied to the setting seed.
  - Regions are diverse in size, population, and challenges, with the AI determining their characteristics on the fly.
- **Map Matrix**:
  - The AI creates a flexible grid system (e.g., a matrix of cells) to track locations, with the size and composition determined dynamically based on the world’s scope.
  - Each cell represents a distinct location (e.g., wilderness, settlement, landmark), with tags generated by the AI.
  - **Settlements & Cities**: The AI designates certain cells as settlements or cities, each containing a sub-matrix for districts, streets, and key buildings.
  - **Buildings & Interiors**: Important buildings (e.g., taverns, temples) have interior matrices representing rooms or functional spaces, generated as needed.
  - **NPC Placement & Movement**: NPCs are assigned home cells and follow AI-generated schedules (e.g., day/night cycles, occupation-based routes) or react to player actions.
  - **Dynamic Updates**: As the player explores or interacts with the world, the AI updates cell states (e.g., discovered, altered) in Mem0, enabling spatial queries like "/locate nearest inn."
- **Factions & Reputation**: The AI generates a dynamic number of factions (not fixed to three), each with unique goals and relationships. Reputation scores (-5 to +5) are tracked for each faction, influencing NPC behavior and quest availability.

### 2.2 Character Creation

- **Attributes**: The AI guides the player in allocating points to six attributes—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma—using a point-buy system (e.g., 15 points).
- **Background Traits**: The player selects or suggests background traits, and the AI generates situational bonuses (e.g., "Merchant’s Wit: +2 to haggling") based on the player’s input.
- **Skills & Proficiencies**: The AI offers a list of skills for the player to allocate points to (e.g., 5 points), and suggests tool proficiencies based on the character’s background.
- **Talents/Feats Tree**: The AI presents talent options from branches like Combat, Social, or Arcane, allowing the player to choose one starting talent. Additional talents may be unlocked dynamically.
- **Spellcasters & Technologists (Optional)**:
  - **Magic**: If the world includes magic, the AI assigns a Spell Points pool (e.g., 10 points) and generates a list of known spells.
  - **Technology**: For tech-based worlds, the AI provides a Tech Points pool and generates gadgets or programs.
  - The AI determines resource recovery rules (e.g., half on short rest, full on long rest) and may introduce unique mechanics based on the world’s theme.

## 3. Core Mechanics

### 3.1 Resolution System

- **Dice Rolls**: Players use "/roll 1d20 + modifier" against a Difficulty Class (DC) set by the AI (ranging from 8 to 30).
- **Modifiers**: Calculated as Attribute + Proficiency + Talent + Situational Bonuses, with the AI generating situational modifiers dynamically.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The AI adjusts DCs in real-time based on the player’s recent performance, the narrative context, and the evolving game state to maintain balanced challenge.

### 3.2 Combat

- **Initiative**: Determined by d20 + Dexterity modifier, with potential bonuses from talents.
- **Zones & Cover**:
  - The AI generates abstract combat zones based on the location (e.g., a tavern might have "bar area," "tables," "entrance").
  - Attacks across zones incur penalties (e.g., -1 per zone gap), and cover provides defensive bonuses (e.g., +2 AC).
- **Actions**:
  - **Standard**: Attack, Cast/Deploy, Dash, Disengage.
  - **Bonus**: Talents, Spells, Tech.
  - **Reaction**: Defensive or opportunistic moves.
- **Ranged Combat**:
  - The AI tracks ammunition or charge for ranged weapons.
  - Ranged attacks use the appropriate attribute + proficiency, with disadvantage beyond effective range.
- **Deception & Tactical Maneuvers**:
  - Feints and stealth attacks involve Deception vs. Insight checks, with success granting advantage or surprise.
  - The AI may introduce unique maneuvers (e.g., Grapple, Disarm) based on the situation.
- **Environmental Hazards**: The AI dynamically generates hazards or interactive elements (e.g., chandelier to swing from, barrels to roll) based on the location.

### 3.3 Magic & Technology

- **System Selection**: The AI decides whether the world includes Magic, Technology, both, or neither, based on the setting seed and player preferences.
- **Magic Mechanics**:
  - Spell Points cost is determined by the AI (e.g., spell level × 2).
  - The AI may introduce rituals or unique spell effects tied to the world’s lore.
- **Technology Mechanics**:
  - Tech Points cost is set dynamically (e.g., gadget tier × 2).
  - Crafting or deployment requires Tool checks, with the AI generating relevant DCs.
- **Hybrid Play**: If both systems are present, the AI manages separate resource pools and introduces interactions between magic and technology.

## 4. Progression & Advancement

- **Experience System**: The AI uses a hybrid of XP and Milestones:
  - Awards XP for successful actions (e.g., +1 XP per skill or combat success).
  - Grants larger XP bonuses at narrative milestones (e.g., +10 XP).
  - Level up occurs at thresholds determined by the AI (e.g., 100 XP).
- **Level Benefits**: The AI grants talent points, hit dice increases, and additional resources (e.g., +1 Spell Point) upon leveling.
- **Artifact Traits**: At higher levels, the AI generates unique artifacts with random traits (e.g., "Life-stealing," "Teleport-on-Critical") tailored to the player’s journey.

---

## 5. Social Interaction & Reputation

- **Reputation Tracker**: The AI dynamically generates faction relationships and tracks reputation scores (-5 to +5), influencing NPC dialogue and quest outcomes.
- **Social Combos**: If multiple players or NPCs assist in social encounters, the AI grants bonuses (e.g., +2 to rolls).
- **Downtime Projects**: The AI allows players to allocate time for crafting, research, or other activities, generating relevant checks and outcomes.
- **Session Zero Questionnaire**: The AI queries the player on tone, violence level, and preferences, storing responses in Mem0 to tailor the experience.

---

## 6. Exploration & Travel

- **Resource Tracking**: The AI manages resources like rations and water, generating survival challenges (e.g., Survival checks every few days).
- **Light & Visibility**: In dark environments, the AI imposes penalties (e.g., disadvantage on Perception) unless the player has a light source.
- **Random Encounters**: The AI generates encounters dynamically based on the terrain and player actions, using virtual tables or on-the-fly creation.

---

## 7. Random Tables & Modular Content

- **Encounter Generation**: The AI creates encounters on the fly, potentially using virtual dice rolls (e.g., 1d6 for creature type, 1d4 for twists).
- **NPC Quirk Generator**: The AI assigns quirks and motivations to NPCs dynamically, ensuring each character feels unique.
- **Side-Quest Pool**: The AI maintains a pool of active side quests, introducing them organically as the player explores new areas.

---

## 8. Crafting, Economy & Items

- **Recipes & DCs**: The AI generates crafting recipes and sets DCs based on the world’s economy and available materials (e.g., Healing Potion: DC15).
- **Tool Checks**: Crafting requires proficiency + tool checks, with the AI determining success or failure.
- **Item Durability**: The AI tracks item durability, reducing it on critical hits and requiring repairs via downtime activities.

---

## 9. AI-Specific Automation & UX

- **Integrated Dice Roller**: The AI processes "/roll" commands, generates results, and logs them in Mem0.
- **Session Recaps**: After each session, the AI generates a narrative recap stored in Mem0.
- **Branching Narratives**: The AI checkpoints key player choices, adapting Acts II and III dynamically.
- **NPC Schedules & Agendas**: The AI manages NPC routines and updates their locations in real-time.
- **Accessibility Shortcuts**: The AI creates custom commands (e.g., "/recall event") based on the player’s playstyle and past actions.
- **Multi-Party Scaling**: If multiple players are present, the AI adjusts DCs and encounter difficulty dynamically.

---

## 10. Win/Lose Conditions & Game State

- **Victory Conditions**: The AI defines victory based on completing the main quest or achieving high faction favor (e.g., +5).
- **Failure States**: The AI determines failure through party wipeout, critical plot failures, or severe reputation loss (e.g., -5).
- **Persistence**: The AI uses Mem0 to store the evolving game state, including the world map, character sheets, NPC data, and session logs, ensuring continuity across sessions.
